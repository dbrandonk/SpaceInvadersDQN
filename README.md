## Project Brief
Farting around with ray's rllib, made a space invaders agent with it.

## Installation
pip install .

## Launching

To be run at the root of the project.

- python3 src/SpaceInvadersDQN/train.py trains the agent.
- python3 src/SpaceInvadersDQN/run.py runs pretrained agent.
- view training results with tensorboard.

## TODO

- tuning?
- mypy?
- technical explanations?
